# Example Interaction
#
# Given the following incoming trades, each line represents one csv row:
#   (1) okfq-xbt-usd,14682.26,2,1514765115
#   (2) okf1-xbt-usd,13793.65,2,1514765115
#   (3) stmp-xbt-usd,13789.01,0.00152381,1514765115
#
# When you receive trade 1 through to your algorithm, if you decide to make
# a BUY trade for 3 xbt, the order will start to fill in the following steps
#   [1] 1 unit xbt from trade 1 (%50 available volume from the trade data)
#   [2] 1 unit xbt from trade 2
#   [3] receiving trade 3, you decide to put in another BUY trade:
#       i. Trade will be rejected, because we have not finished filling your 
#          previous trade
#       ii. The fill object will contain additional fields with error data
#           a. "error_code", which will be "rejected"; and
#           b. "error_msg", description why the trade was rejected.
#
# Responses during these iterations:
#   [1] success resulting in:
#       {
#           "price": 14682.26,
#           "volume": 1,
#           "unfilled": {"xbt": 2, "eth": 0 }

#       }
#
# In step 3, the new trade order that you submitted is rejected; however,
# we will continue to fill that order that was already in progress, so
# the price and volume are CONFIRMED in that payload.
